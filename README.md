 
Thank you for visiting us here on Github, shout out to them for making this possible to get our info out to ppl.

Dayz Ages is based on 1.8 core and has alot of improvements. We have added a lot of community based addons to enhance 
the Dayz experience in hopes that ppl will enjoy it for more than a few months. Here at Ages you will find all kinds of cool stuff, ranging from Roaming AI, to Recruitable Mercs, and ofcourse tons of helpful scripts. Our initial map will start in Chernarus and in time players will be able to transition from chernarus to other maps like, Namalsk, lingor, panthera, and more as we develop. Our mod will not be a Pure PVP/PVE server we are working to make it a true COOP survival game, and there
are perks that can only be achieved by working with players. Also we are not gonna be a "care bear server", we enjoy the game for what it is and hope others will aswell. 

 MORE TO COME!!!!
